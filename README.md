# PvM Scheduler
This is aimed for persons who regularly host PvM sessions. It is sometimes hard to keep track on a daily basis with lists. Mistakes are bound to happen *(personal experience)*. This bot will keep track of these PvMing events and roles and will notify the attendees.

This software is free to re-use. You get the source code, but you have to host/set up your own discord bot.

## Discord
Documentation on how to set-up your (private) Discord bot can be found [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). This [turtorial](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) might also help.
